"""NVFP4 TensorCore availability gate (shared by addmm patch + TC forward).

Stock Comfy / kitchen NVFP4 (comfy_kitchen.tensor.nvfp4) does NOT permanently
disable TC after CUBLAS_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED. It falls back to dequant for
**that call only**, then retries TC on the next Linear.

This module matches that contract:
  1) probe CC once (Blackwell family: CC >= 10.0)
  2) permanent disable ONLY when hardware cannot do NVFP4 TC (CC < 10.0)
  3) CUBLAS / RuntimeError on a call → per-call dequant (no process-wide kill)

Never edits ComfyUI-master.
